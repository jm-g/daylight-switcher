daylight-switcher is a tool to toggle between day and night settings for
hacking. It switches all Terminal.app windows and tabs to the dark or light
variant of the Solarized color scheme in one go.

Further plans:
- switch also MacVIM, Intelij in one go
- have one shortcut to select the currently right settings, based on time, locaation 
  and light sensor in macbooks
